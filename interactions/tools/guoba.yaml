      **What is GUOBA?** <:GuobaStare:1014297605670453390>
      A project meant to collect data across different accounts to improve standardization of calculations (such as KQMS). It's also a fun leaderboard to compare the state of your artifacts with others.

      **What's the plan?** 
      GUOBA will be run in two phases: one in 3.0, open until <t:1662497999> <t:1662497999:R>.
      Later on, we open it again and keep it open for a while longer.

      **How can I help?**
      All you have to do is put your artifacts in Genshin Optimizer, export the database and fill in the form below. You will be asked to verify a handful of artifacts by equipping them on characters in your profile (so they are visible on [Enka.Network](https://enka.network/)).
